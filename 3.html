<h2>squat는 어떻게 해야하는가?</h2>
<p>With this version of the squat, we are going to start out the same way,
only instead of using a thumbless grip, we are going to put our thumbs around the bar.
The same thing goes with the grip – the narrower the grip, the better of a “shelf” will be formed on your back to hold the bar.

However, a super narrow grip is hard to achieve, especially when starting out, due to lack of flexibility.
Instead of placing the bar on your back on your rear deltoids, you’re going to be placing the bar about two inches higher up, on your traps.
The bar will then be across your shoulders.</p>

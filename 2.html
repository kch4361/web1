<h2>bench press는 어떻게 해야하는가?</h2>
<p>Let’s go through the basics, before we talk about tweaking and improving the move.

Lie flat on your back on a bench.
Grip the bar with hands just wider than shoulder-width apart, so when you’re at the bottom of your move your hands are directly above your elbows.
This allows for maximum force generation.
Bring the bar slowly down to your chest as you breathe in.
Push up as you breathe out, gripping the bar hard and watching a spot on the ceiling rather than the bar, so you can ensure it travels the same path every time.
What could go wrong, right? In reality it can be very easy to tear the stabilising rotator cuff muscles around your shoulders that can be difficult to patch  up.
Prevention is far better than cure, so set your ego to one side and first learn how to perform it safely.</p>

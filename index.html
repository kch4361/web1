  Although it's a good idea to frequently switch out your workouts, here are three movements that should always be included.

Although it's a good idea to frequently switch out your workouts, three movements that should always be included, especially for hardgainers, are the so-called "Big Three"; bench press, squat, and deadlift.

These three movements are called this mainly because they work several muscle groups, and for overall strength and mass gains, they just can't be beat.
I'm going to go into a little detail about form, variations, and purpose of each one of them.

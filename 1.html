<h2>deadlift는 어떻게 해야하는가?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWk7Z6EvLRg" target="_blank" title="deadlift speicipfcation">The barbell deadlift</a> is one of the best exercises around, period. Whether you want to build muscle, burn fat, increase athleticism, or focus purely on gaining strength,
it's the one movement every lifter must do.
But it only helps you out<strong> if you <u>learn</u> to do it right.</strong></p>
<img src="dead1.jpg" width="100%">
The hip hinge is exactly what it sounds like: hinging at the hips. It's not sitting down, but more like sitting back. This is one of the main things that makes it different from a squat.
The movement comes from your hips, not your knees. It's like a horizontal thrust: your butt goes back as you sit back, then you fire your glutes forward as you stand up.</p>
